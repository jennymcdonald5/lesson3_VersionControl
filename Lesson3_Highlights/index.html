            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is one main repository for all of the project files. Members of a team are able to share files with each other as well as edit and share the changes made. Developers can pull a file from the server, add or remove information, and then return, or commit, the files back to the server for other people to view. Version control system (VCS) is a program that automatically saves specific thing such as: which member revised the file, the date that the revision took place, the details in the file that are new or different than before, and VCS can combine the changes in the same file. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control system has several benefits. The program is a place where several people can share and edit files while the program itself automatically saves the changes. One huge benefit of the version control system is that all of the work within a project will have a backup file to insure that no one loses anything. Files also cannot be overwritten. Both of these benefits are very useful in several cases where a person could be at risk of losing all of their work or overwriting the file. The main purpose behind this program is that people can work together and share files, so version control system allows multiple users to work simultaneously on the same files without any conflict. This is a huge, and maybe the most important, benefit as this allows users. who are not necessarily together in person, to still work together at the same time.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a type of distributed version control system that is free and open. It is designed to handle all types of projects from big to small with any number of people. As this program is designed to be used for group projects, every member part of the project has an individual copy of the project stored on their own computer. It also has a safety measure where GIT will prevent an accidental overwrite of a file. Therefore, the user is protected from accidentally replacing files with others. GIT promises to process data much faster as well which results in more projects being completed in less amount of time.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Commands of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT has several commands ranging from basic to remote. A few of the basic commands include git init, git add, and git commit. Git init is a command that can turn a directory into an empty repository and it is also the first step that is taken in order to add and commit files to the repository. The next command is git add which allows the user to add files. Even though the file is added, it is not completely uploaded because it first needs to be committed. In order to fully add the data, git commit must be used. Basically, this command allows the changes to be recorded to the repository. The files can then be accessed.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Commands of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main remote commands used within GIT. The first remote command is git remote which is used to connect a local repository to a remote repository. Next, in order to receive the latest and most up-to-date version of the repository, the command git pull must be used. Changes that may have been made to the remote repository are pulled so that you can view them. The last remote command of GIT is git push. This command is responsible for pushing the commits made on the local repository to the remote repository. This command requires two things: a remote repository as well as a branch name.</p>
